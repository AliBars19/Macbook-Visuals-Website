        <p>
          MacbookVisuals is a private, local-first tool designed to streamline
          the creation and publishing of short-form video content.
        </p>

        <p>
          The platform was built to solve a simple problem: managing large
          batches of videos while maintaining full creative control.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of uploading directly to social platforms, videos are first
          ingested into a local dashboard where captions, scheduling, and
          publishing decisions can be made deliberately.
        </p>

        <p>
          MacbookVisuals is designed to integrate with automated workflows,
          including After Effects pipelines and scripting tools, while still
          allowing for manual review and intervention.
